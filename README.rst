Elysia
=========

|License| |Codacy| |Black| |Telegram Channel| |Telegram Chat|

A multipurpose Telegram Bot made with Pyrogram and asynchronous programming.

The Meaning Of Elysia!
------------
The name Elysia is derived from the Greek word "Elysium," which refers to a paradise or a place of eternal happiness and bliss in Greek mythology. Elysium was believed to be a peaceful and beautiful afterlife where heroes and virtuous individuals would reside. Therefore, the name Elysia carries connotations of serenity, joy, and heavenly beauty.

Requirements
------------
- Python 3.7+
- An Unix-like operating system (Windows support isn't tested. In case you find any issues inside Windows, please file an issue)


Setup
-----
1. Create a virtualenv (This step is optional, but **highly** recommended to avoid dependency conflicts)

   - ``python3 -m venv .venv`` (You don't need to run it again)
   - ``. .venv/bin/activate`` (You must run this every time you open the project in a new shell)

2. Install the required modules with ``pip3 install -Ue .``.
3. Go to https://my.telegram.org/apps and create a new app.
4. Create a new ``config.py`` file from the ``config.py.example`` file (``cp config.py.example config.py``).
5. Place your token, IDs and api keys to your config.py file.


Running
-------
- To run the bot you just need to run ``python3 -m Elysia``. In case you installed from a virtualenv, run ``. .venv/bin/activate`` before this.
- Running it on `screen <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen>`__ or `tmux <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux>`__ is highly recommended if you want to keep the bot running on a server.


Note
----
If you find any bugs/issues with the bot you have three options:

- Create a new issue in our `GitHub <https://github.com/lalrochhara/Elysia>`__ describing the issue.
- Send the /bug command to `bot's <https://t.me/dElysia_Bot>`__ chat describing the issue.
- If you know how to fix the issue, fork our repo and open up a pull request.


Translations
------------
Translations should be done in our `Localazy project <https://localazy.com/p/famhawite-infosys-multi-lingual-project>`__,
as Localazy checks for grammar issues, provides improved context about the string being translated and so on,
thus possibly providing better quality translations. But you can also submit a pull request if you prefer translating that way.
